            <p>If you have a great design, you're in the right place. That's because Printable gives you the opportunity to printable your ideas by selling your designs on custom products such as apparel, accessories, home decor and more. Furthermore, we manage automated order production and shipping, so you can focus on selling
            </p>
            <p>Each time one of your customers makes an order from your store your credit card or PayPal account (whichever one you choose to setup) will be debited for the cost of the product and the cost of the shipping.
            </p>
            <p>Ex: Your customers purchase a t-shirt for $25 and pays you $4.00 for shipping for a total revenue to your Shopify account of $29.00. At the same time the Printable app will charge for the cost of the product. If we are to use a Next Level T-Shirt the cost would be $13 + $4 (domestic shipping for first item at $2 for each additional item) for a total debit of $17. 
            </p>
            <p>What makes our offer even more special is that we are not a 3rd part print provider. WE ARE THE PRINTER. So you don't have to deal with middleman sending your orders to different printers. We print your products the same way each time, so that your customers are used to the best quality, always.

                  </strong>
                  <br>
                  This depends on a few different variables. For example, we have shirts from different brands, and each brand has different prices. Before you choose the shirts you want to sell, you need to have a clear understanding which brands are suited for your store.

                  <br>
                  First of all, you need to set up your account and choose a preferred payment method. You can pay using your credit card or PayPal. Once you sell something, Printable automatically receives the production request. We deduct the cost to produce the products from the credit card linked to your account.
