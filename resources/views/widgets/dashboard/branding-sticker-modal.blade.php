                <p>Upload a design for a sticker that we'll adhere to the outside of your package to make your branding super obvious. The design must be exactly 3x2 inches (WxH). We'll round the corners a little bit when we print, so don't place important content around the corners.</p>

                <p>Colors must be in black and white, no gradients. A visible, clear brand name works the best. Make sure it's at least 150 dpi for best quality.</p>
                
                <p>This is available at no extra cost, and it's optional. See the preview image to get an idea of what it would look like. If you don't upload a design, we'll send out your package without any exterior branding.</p>
